Enterprise Web Software Development 

System Requirements :

You are required to build a secure web-enabled role-based system for collecting ideas for
improvement from students in a large University.
The system must meet the following criteria:
 The University has a Quality Assurance Manager to oversee the process.
 All Departments have a QA coordinator who is responsible for managing the process
for their Department, and for encouraging students to contribute.
 All students have the opportunity to submit one or more ideas.
 All students must agree to Terms and Conditions before they can submit.
 All students can optionally upload documents to support their ideas.
 All ideas can be categorised (tagged) from a list of categories at the point when they
are submitted.
 The QA Manager can add additional categories at any time, and can delete categories,
but only if they have not been used.
 All staff and students can see all submitted ideas and can comment on any idea. They
can also give the Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down for any idea, but only once for any
idea
 Staff comments are only visible to other staff. Student comments are visible to both
staff and students,
 Ideas and comments can be posted anonymously, although the author’s details will be
stored in the database so any inappropriate ideas can be investigated.
 All new ideas are disabled after a closure date for new ideas, but comments can
continue to be done until a final closure date.
 Once an idea is submitted the system emails a notification to the Department’s QA
Coordinator. The author of an idea receives an automatic email notification whenever a comment is
submitted to any of their ideas by a student (but not by a member of staff).
 Lists of Most Popular Ideas (+1 for Thumbs Up, -1 for Thumbs Down), Most Viewed
Ideas, Latest Ideas and Latest Comments must be made available to all staff.
 Lists of Ideas need to be paginated (5 per page)
 The University QA Manager needs to be able to download all the selected
contributions after the final closure date in a ZIP file for transfer out of the system.
 An administrator is needed to maintain any system data, e.g. closure dates for each
academic year, staff details, student details.
 Statistical analysis (e.g. number of ideas per Department) needs to be available.
 The interface must be suitable for all devices (eg mobile phones, tablets, desktops).
Assumptions
You must clearly state any assumptions you make.
Reports
A number of reports need to be made available. For example
 Statistics
o Number of ideas made by each Department.
o Percentage of ideas by each Department.
o Number of contributors within each Department.
 Exception reports
o Ideas without a comment.
o Anonymous ideas and comments.
